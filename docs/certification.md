    For IBMers and Business Partners to receive credit for completing this lab, you must pass a certification quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of 5 multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question.

    The quiz questions will ask you about on-screen text or descriptions that will come up as you work through the lab guide. You will be prompted in the lab guide instructions to **record this** information (or screenshot â€” your preference) like below:
