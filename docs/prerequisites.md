6. Click **Submit**.

Once your reservation has been submitted, it will take a few minutes (typically under 10) for it to be processed. During this time, you will likely receive at least 3 emails. The first will be an email confirming the reservation request and that it is in process.  The second email will arrive once your reservation is complete and the environment is ready for use. It is **critical** that you read this email and record **namespace** you have been assigned.  You will find this in the body of the email and it will look something like:

**Namespace: 1234567abc-nh-ns**

You will use this information later in the lab guide.

The 3rd email you receive will be an invitation to join an IBM Cloud account.  It is **critical** that you accept the invitation by following the instructions and link provided in the email.
